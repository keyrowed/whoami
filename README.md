# whoami

In case I ever need to prove who I am down the line, I've made a small program.

To use the program, first clone the repository with:

```
git clone https://github.com/keyrowed/whoami.git
```

Then, run the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```
cargo run --release -- --input <your input>
```
